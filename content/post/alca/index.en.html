<h1>Australian Land Conservation Alliance Conference #PLC2022</h1>
<p>The Australian Land Conservation Alliance is a member organisation made up of people and organisations that contribute to private land conservation. I attended the virtual PLC2022 organised by ALCA on the 8 to 10 March. I presented in the ‘NSW Research Showcase’ and spoke about my work at UQ on research funded by the NSW Koala Research Strategy.</p>
