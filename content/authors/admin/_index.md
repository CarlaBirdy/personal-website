Harmonising the ways in which people and societies engage with their natural environment to conserve ecosystems, produce food and develop areas is one of lifeâ€™s great balancing acts. My research to date focuses on understanding this balance by leaning into interdisciplinary approaches and spatial analysis using {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} and {{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}}.

At Deakin University my research aims to provide pathways towards sustainable environmental and food futures for Australian agricultural landscape. Some of my previous projects has focused on private land conservation programs, wildlife management in urban areas, avian ecology, invasive species management of cavity-nesting birds, international conservation policy and effectiveness, conservation finance and crowdfunding, and perceptions of sea-level rise of people living in coastal areas.
