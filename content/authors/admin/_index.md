Harmonising the ways in which people and societies engage with their natural environment to conserve ecosystems, produce food and develop areas is one of lifeâ€™s great balancing acts. My research to date focuses on understanding this balance by leaning into interdisciplinary approaches and spatial analysis.

At Deakin University my research aims to provide pathways towards sustainable environmental and food futures for Australian agricultural landscape as apart of the Land Use Futures Project with the Planet A lab, CSIRO and Climate Works. I am particularly passionate about private land conservation and am eager to research and deliver real-world impacts in collaboration with the academic and industry partners. Overall my research aims to adopt a holistic perspective and spatial analysis {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} to understand how conservation fits into broader systems, such as food systems.

Some of my previous projects has focused on wildlife management in urban areas, avian ecology, invasive species management of cavity-nesting birds, international conservation policy and effectiveness, conservation finance and crowdfunding, and perceptions of sea-level rise of people living in coastal areas. My last postdoc position at the University of Queensland aimed to develop tools and guidance into how investments in private land conservation initiatives can be designed to maximise the conservation of koalas across New South Wales under the uncertainties of climate change. My involvement in this project has lead to a successful ARC Linkage grant in which I am a Chief Investigator.

During my PhD research at The University of Queensland, I utilized an interdisciplinary approach and a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the impacts of private land conservation programs on people and the environment. Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated a Bachelor of Applied Science from The University of Queensland in 2012 and received first-class honours for my research on urban restoration and bird diversity in South-east Queensland.
